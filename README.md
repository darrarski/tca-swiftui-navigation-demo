## üìù Description

This is a demo project that shows how to implement navigation in SwiftUI iOS application using [Swift Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). It uses `NavigationLink` to push screens onto the navigation stack. App state is managed using Composable Architecture. It also contains logic responsible for handling long-living effects and dismissing the stack to the root view (pop-to-root).
