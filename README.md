## üìù Description

This is a demo project that shows how to implement navigation in SwiftUI iOS application using [Swift Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture). It uses `NavigationLink` to push screens onto the navigation stack. App state is managed using Composable Architecture. It also contains logic responsible for handling long-living effects and dismissing the stack to the root view (pop-to-root).

Solutions used in this project are described in the article: [Thoughts on SwiftUI navigation](https://github.com/darrarski/darrarski/blob/main/2021/04/Thoughts-on-SwiftUI-navigation/README.md).
